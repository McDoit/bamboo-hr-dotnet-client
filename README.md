# BambooHR .NET Client

A .NET client for BambooHR.


## Demo Project

A demo project is included!  Before running it, make sure you look at the `Program.cs` file and fill in the blanks to actually get some data.  Also peruse the commented out code for additional samples.

Also, make sure you update the App.Config with your API stuffs.  It will look something like this:

    <add key="BambooApiUser" value="email@example.com" />
    <add key="BambooApiKey" value="sadjlksdfguoi45u498j0sdfjoiksdfj08sdf" />
    <add key="BambooApiUrl" value="https://api.bamboohr.com/api/gateway.php/examplecompanyname/v1" />
